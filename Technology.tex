\section{Technology}
In Formula 1, each car is equipped with over 300 sensors, generating 1.1 million datapoints between the racetrack and the pits\cite{DCFrontier}. Through the years, Formula 1 has adopted new technologies and have traditionally been on the forefront of wireless technology. Different proprietary WiFi solutions have been used for telemetry between the cars on the track, and recently, 5G has been adopted to be used for telemetry\cite{FastCompany}. As 5G is still relatively new, we may not have coverage at the track, so it is safer to base this discussion on 4G/LTE.

\subsection{LTE}
LTE has one big advantage over LoRa, in that it has a much higher bitrate at 300 Mbps download and 75 Mbps upload, or even higher with newer LTE technology\cite{MobilePDF}.
